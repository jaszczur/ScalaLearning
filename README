Just some fun with Scala - nothing useful.

This project uses SBT as a build tool. You can modify sources in Eclipse with the Scala plugin. Remember to pick up plugin with version compatible with exact Scala build (see project/plugins/build.sbt). Next run 'sbt eclipse' - that will generate Eclipse project files. Now you can import the project to your workspace.
